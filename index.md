## About

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Basel](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/). 

My interests lie in health economics, labour economics, social insurance design and applied econometrics.

My research studies how individuals respond to the economic incentives created by health insurance, unemployment insurance, and income taxation systems. 
I develop new causal identification designs derived from theoretical models, and implement them using large administrative datasets. 

Current topics include 
- The strategic timing of healthcare consumption 
- The design of unemployment insurance with heterogeneous responses to coverage generosity
- The heterogeneity in labour supply responses of low-income workers. 


Please download my CV [here](docs/Zabrodina_CV_Nov2021.pdf), or get in touch by [email](mailto:vera.zabrodina@unibas.ch). 

I will be visiting the [Center for Labor Economics](http://cle.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, from January to March 2022. 

Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a research fellow in health economics at [Unisanté](https://www.unisante.ch/fr).

## Research 
 
### Working papers

- Timing Moral Hazard under Deductibles in Health Insurance. --- draft available upon request

  <details style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <summary style="color:#2a7ae2;">Abstract</summary>
    
    This paper develops a new approach to identifying timing moral hazard in health insurance contracts when deductible choice is endogenous. I set up a dynamic model of healthcare consumption where individuals exceed a high deductible after a large health shock. I show that individuals either strategically prepone care from the year after the shock and keep a high deductible, or postpone and switch to a low deductible the year after. The identification of timing moral hazard exploits the randomness of shock timing within a calendar year and future prices. Empirical results show little evidence for timing moral hazard, but significant differences in switching to a lower deductible. This pattern suggests that there is limited scope for preponing care, and within-year incentives are more important than cross-year incentives in shaping healthcare consumption.

- Unemployment Insurance with Response Heterogeneity (with [Conny Wunsch](https://sites.google.com/view/cwunsch)). --- draft available upon request
  
  <details style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <summary style="color:#2a7ae2;">Abstract</summary>
    
    This paper studies whether responses to unemployment insurance (UI) vary with age and social security contribution time -- two dimensions widely used to differentiate UI policy across workers. In the presence of heterogeneity in responses to UI, average estimates may veil opportunities for welfare-improving redistribution and finer UI design. We use administrative data from Germany and a multi-cutoff regression discontinuity design to estimate a comprehensive set of duration and wage effects at many discontinuities in potential benefit duration. Feeding the estimates into a meta regression, we find that both duration responses and wage losses at reemployment decrease with short-term contribution time. We find a weak and insignificant gradient in age and long-term contribution. This suggests that short-term contribution time is an important determinant of UI responses, and thus a relevant dimension for policy differentiation.
