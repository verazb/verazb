## About

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Basel](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/). 

My interests lie in health economics, labour economics, social insurance design and applied econometrics.

Get in touch by [email](mailto:vera.zabrodina@unibas.ch).

Download my CV [here](docs/Zabrodina_CV_Nov2021.pdf).


**Latest**: I will be visiting the [Center for Labor Economics](http://cle.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, from January to March 2022. 


<br />


I study how individuals respond to the economic incentives created by health insurance, unemployment insurance, and income taxation systems. 
I develop new causal identification designs derived from theoretical models, and implement them using large administrative datasets. 

My current research topics include 
- the strategic timing of healthcare consumption in health insurance
- the design of unemployment insurance with heterogeneous responses to coverage generosity
- and the heterogeneity in labour supply responses of low-income workers. 


Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a research fellow in health economics at [Unisanté](https://www.unisante.ch/fr).

## Teaching 

- **Causal Inference for Policy Evaluation**, University of Basel (2021) 

  For this course lectured by Conny Wunsch, Ulrike Unterhofer and I lead lab sessions where we teach Master's and Ph.D. students how to implement causal inference methods by replicating papers in R. 

  Check out the materials on [GitHub](https://github.com/verazb/Hippo).
