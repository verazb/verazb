### About 

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Basel](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/). 

Research interests: Health economics, labour economics, social insurance design and applied econometrics.

My current research aims to understand how individuals respond to the economic incentives created by health insurance, unemployment insurance, and income taxation systems. 
I develop new causal identification designs derived from theoretical models, and implement them using large administrative datasets. 

Recently, I have studied, e.g. 
- the strategic timing of healthcare consumption in health insurance
- the design of unemployment insurance with heterogeneous responses to coverage generosity
- and the heterogeneity in labour supply responses of low-income workers. 


Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a research fellow in health economics at [Unisant√©](https://www.unisante.ch/fr). 

I will be visiting the [Center for Labor Economics](http://cle.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, from January to March 2022.
