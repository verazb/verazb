## About

Welcome! I am a postdoc in economics at the [University of Basel](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/), where I got my PhD in October 2022. I visited the University of California, Berkeley, in spring 2022. 

My research lies in health, labour, and public economics. I study the optimal design of social insurance and taxation systems. I develop theoretical models that motivate new causal identification designs, and implement them using large administrative or survey data. 

I was awarded the Student Paper Prize 2nd place from the [International Health Economics Association](https://healtheconomics.org/awards/), as well as the Young Economist Award from the [Swiss Society of Economics and Statistics](https://www.sgvs.ch/awards/) in 2023.

## Research 
 
### Working papers

- **[Timing Moral Hazard under Deductibles in Health Insurance](docs/Zabrodina_JMP.pdf)**  (Job market paper)

  <details style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <summary style="color:#2a7ae2;">Abstract</summary>
    
  This paper evaluates whether individuals strategically time their healthcare consumption to reduce out-of-pocket costs, and the frictions they face in doing so. I set up a dynamic model of healthcare consumption in which individuals suffer a large health shock, exceed their deductible, and have an incentive to advance care from the following year. The model provides a sufficient statistic for timing moral hazard by comparing the consumption of individuals with shocks at random times within the coverage year. It also shows that advancing care mitigates classical moral hazard and adverse selection the following year. This insight highlights important trade-offs for insurance market design. In the context of mandatory health insurance in Switzerland, I find substantial timing moral hazard, though with strong dynamic frictions. The shorter the time horizon, the less care is advanced. The timing of health risk realizations has important implications for cost-sharing and insurance premiums.

- **[Unemployment Insurance with Response Heterogeneity](https://docs.iza.org/dp16509.pdf)** (with [Conny Wunsch](https://sites.google.com/view/cwunsch)) 
  
  <details style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <summary style="color:#2a7ae2;">Abstract</summary>
    
  The generosity of social insurance coverage often increases with the beneficiary's age and their contribution time to social security, but existing policies vary considerably. We study the differentiation of unemployment insurance (UI) generosity by evaluating how the insurance-incentive trade-off varies with age and contribution time. We exploit numerous discontinuities in potential benefit duration in Germany. Contribution time in the last three years carries information on job search efforts, as it is associated with lower moral hazard responses and fiscal externality. We find no significant response heterogeneity in age or longer contribution time horizons. Contrasting these gradients with an approximated insurance value for four UI regimes, we document that steepening the potential benefit duration schedule in contribution time and flattening it in age would have increased welfare.

- **Hours Mismatch and Income Tax Incentives for Low-Earning Workers** (with [Ulrike Unterhofer](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/persons/ulrike-unterhofer-1/)) --- draft available upon request
  
  <details style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <summary style="color:#2a7ae2;">Abstract</summary>
    
     Many workers do not work their desired number of hours, particularly in the low-earning segment. We study whether income tax notches generate hours mismatch in the context of mini jobs in Germany. These jobs are exempt from income and social security taxes up until a salient earnings threshold. We find substantial underemployment at the threshold, suggesting that it constrains many workers to work less than their optimum. A reform shifting the threshold upwards raised underemployment among mini jobbers. Workers increased their desired hours, but contracts adjusted through small increases in actual hours and wages. These findings are consistent with firms' hours constraints shaping job offers in the low-earning segment. They suggest that firms cater to workers' incentives to bunch, but overprovide mini jobs. While workers are able to achieve higher earnings in the adjustment, the aggravation in underemployment points to ambiguous effects on worker welfare.
